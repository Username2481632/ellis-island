  <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">You are an immigrant traveling to Ellis Island
    in 1920. You are fleeing from the war in Mexico due to the revolution there, a significant cause of immigration to
    the US in your time. The war drove many people away, and the United States' offer of freedom and happiness sounds
    interesting to you. You are traveling alone. Don't forget that you are traveling in 1920 and not today. One effect
    of this is that unlike today, a job offer in the United States will get you rejected rather than accepted. Today,
    Ellis Island isn't even used anymore, so play around to experience the immigration process of that time. You can
    pick your details and see whether you are accepted and why. <a href="index.html" style="display:inline-flex;">Will you pass?</a></p>
